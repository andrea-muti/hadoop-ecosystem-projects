############## INFORMATIONS ###############

In this mapper only application, we will create a mapper which reads the lines from an input file, 
each line contains the id of the pages visited on the website separated by space. 
Each line is split and total number of pages are counted in that line. 
If they are more than 500, those lines are written to the context.
This is not a big use case but sufficient to clarify how mappers work.


-- DATASET --
Dataset used for this example is available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MSNBC.com+Anonymous+Web+Data
The dataset describes the page visits of users who visited msnbc.com on September 28, 1999. 
Visits are recorded at the level of URL category and are recorded in time order. 
Each single line contains the pages/urls visited in one session by the user. 
Data is anonymized for containing only integers: one integer representing one page.

the dataset is stored in the hdfs at the path /user/Andrea/logprocessor/input.seq
